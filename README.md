# temperature_sensor_ADC_PCB

This a a project going from the design circuit, testing to make PCB: temperature sensor range from -30 degree to +30 degree and transfer the 
analog signal to digital signal, then display the temperature value on serial monitor of Arduino UNO.

The document of project is written in file Final_report
